Description: A novel High-Frequency Sub-Pathways mining approach (HiFreSP) to identify robust prognosis gene signatures. The High-Frequency Genes (HFG) and the High-Frequency Pathways (HFP) scores were calculated to mine the prognosis-related sub-pathways, and this method provided the robustness to the noise of the training set and prevent over fit (see details in ‘Materials and Methods’ section of the paper). 

Depends: R (2.15.2), igraph R package, iSubpathwayMiner R package, survival package

Details:

First step: Executive program: random_cox_pathway.R

random_cox_pathway.R: construct the bootstrap training sets; identify prognosis-related gene sets and prognosis-related pathway sets; calculate the HFG score and HFP score.

Input: genedata: gene expression profile, which must include the survival time st, the censored indicator status, and the gene         expression data, eg. “genedata_eg.csv”

random_times: the times of bootstrap processing, eg. “100”

idconvert: id convert profile, eg. “convertable.csv”

Output: coxresult: the result folder of univariable Cox regression analysis in all bootstrap training sets, eg. “coxresult_1.csv”

enrichment_pathway: the result folder of significant prognosis-related pathway sets in all bootstrap training sets, eg.“signifi_pathways_random_sample1.txt”

pmRNA: the folder of genes frequency in the significant prognosis-related pathway, eg. “statis_path00020.txt”

pid_statis: the frequency of significant prognosis-related pathway, eg, “pid_statis.txt”

Second step: Executive program: subpathway_miner.R

subpathway_miner.R: based on HFG and HFP scores from random_cox_pathway, mine prognosis related sub-pathways 

It depends on four functions: annotation.R; 

Dependent function -- annotation.R: get KO sub-pathway annotation

Input: train_set: gene expression profile, eg. “genedata_eg.csv”

random_times: the times of bootstrap processing, eg. “100”
      
T: the threshold of HFP score, eg. “0.5”
      
idconvert: id convert profile, eg. “convertable.csv”

robs_mRNA: the high-frequency-genes in the significant prognosis-related pathway from the output of random_cox_pathway.R, which is “statis_path00020.txt”

pid_names: the frequency of significant prognosis-related pathway from the output of random_cox_pathway.R, which is “pid_statis.txt”

Output: 

subpathway: the folder of the significant subpathways, eg. “subpathways_path04530.txt”
In “subpathways_path04530.txt”, each row of the results represents a subpathway. The meaning of each column is as follows: 

PathwayID--The identifier of the subpathway

PathwayName--The name of the pathway

annMoleculeRatio--The ratio of the annotated genes. For example, 9/5909 means that 9 of 5909 genes of interest are annotated to the subpathway

annBgRatio--The ratio of the annotated genes of the background. For example, 12/25051 means that 12 genes in 25051 genes of background are annotated to the subpathway 

pvalue--The P-value of the hypergeometric test 

fdr--Benjamini-hochberg FDR value

annMoleculeList--The molecules annotated to this subpathway 

pdf: the folder of the significant subpathway’s KM curve in the training set, eg. “train_path04530_1.pdf”

the set of the significant subpathways, eg. “result_subpathway_n1s5.txt”

In “result_subpathway_n1s5.txt”, each row of the results represents a subpathway. The meaning of each column is as follows:

pathwayid --The identifier of the pathway

subpathwayid--The identifier of the subpathway

r_mRNA--The genes of interest that are annotated to the subpathway

ptrain_KM--The KM p value of the subpathway in the training set
