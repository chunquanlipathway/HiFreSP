Description: A novel High-Frequency Sub-Pathways mining approach (HiFreSP) to identify robust prognosis gene signatures. The High-
Frequency Genes (HFG) and the High-Frequency Pathways (HFP) scores were calculated to mine the prognosis-related sub-pathways, and this 
method provided the robustness to the noise of the training set and prevent over fit (see details in ‘Materials and Methods’ section of 
the paper). 

Depends: R (2.15.2), igraph R package, iSubpathwayMiner R package, survival package
